CS 170 Fall 2019 Project

Things to do:

Implement getCandidates() at solver.py

getShortestDistanceMatrix() in shortest_path_algorithm.py sould also return previous[][] that can be used to find the shortest path between two points.

Implement getTSPslow() in approximate_TSP.py to use brute-force for small number of drop-off locations and optN-exchange with brute-force for large number of drop-off locations.
